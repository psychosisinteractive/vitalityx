Interrupt 3\+Fh is the standard VitalityX software interrupt. You interrupt 3\+Fh to run VitalityX functions while in usermode.

For example, to write to Bochs (emulation software) output (in Intel syntax)\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
        mov eax,0x01 ; Set mode to Bochs Output
        mov ebx,string ; Set ebx to string pointer
        int 3fh ; Interrupt VitalityX
string: db 'Hello VitalityX!',0
\end{DoxyCode}


Here is the current list of supported interrupts\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
eax 0x01:

gets:
ebx \{string\}
sets:
none

This will write \{string\} terminated with 0x0 to the Bochs output.

eax 0x02:

gets:
ebx \{string\}
sets:
none

This will write \{string\} terminated with 0x0 to the graphical output.

eax 0x03:

gets:
edi \{code pointer\}
edx \{mode\}
sets:
ebx \{entry id\}

This will add a VLib entry and give you the VLib entry ID.

eax 0x04:

gets:
none
sets:
none

This yields the current task.

eax 0x05:

gets:
ebx \{entry id\}
sets:
none by the interrupt, but the vlib entry may

This calls a VLib Function by its entry ID.
\end{DoxyCode}
